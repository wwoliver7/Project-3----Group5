## Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset spanning from July 2018 to May 2020, containing information on electricity usage and temperatures for the top 10 cities in the United States. Using a Data Engineering approach, we investigate the correlations between a cityâ€™s electricity usage and its average temperature. Our analysis involves transforming the dataset through an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow, utilizing the Python pandas library for data manipulation.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, accessible via the following link: [US Top 10 Cities Electricity and Weather Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamkulkarni01/us-top-10-cities-electricity-and-weather-data)

The project workflow includes:

- Loading electric demand data from the provided CSV file `cleaned_elec_data.csv`.
- Formatting the date/time column.
- Converting the date/time to the Central Time Zone for each city.
- Converting the date/time to Unix time.
- Dropping unnecessary columns and renaming columns for clarity.
- Splitting the data into separate DataFrames for each city.
- Removing daylight saving time (DST) dates, excluding Phoenix.
- Deduplicating the data.
- Outputting the rows of each city's DataFrame to separate CSV files.
- Converting climate data from JSON files to CSV format for SQL compatibility.

## PostgreSQL Integration
After processing and transforming the data, we stored it in a PostgreSQL database to facilitate relational analysis. Each output CSV file was imported into the database, with each file corresponding to a separate table. We established connections between these tables based on the Unix timestamps, allowing for efficient querying and analysis across multiple dimensions. This relational structure enables us to explore relationships between electricity usage, city climate, and other factors with greater flexibility and depth.

## Ethical Considerations

The dataset utilized in this project originates from two primary sources: the Energy Information Administration (EIA) for electricity usage data and DarkSky for weather data. The dataset spans from July 2018 to May 2020, providing approximately 24 months of hourly observations for various cities in the United States. Despite the aggregation of data at the city level, ethical considerations remain pertinent. Firstly, there is a need to ensure the responsible handling and storage of the data to safeguard against unauthorized access and breaches of privacy. 

Additionally, while the aggregated nature of the data mitigates individual privacy concerns, there is still the potential for bias in the analysis and interpretation of the results. Care must be taken to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or drawing conclusions that could inadvertently harm certain communities within the cities studied. Transparency in data analysis methodologies and clear communication of findings are crucial to mitigating ethical risks and ensuring the integrity of the project's outcomes.
